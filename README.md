# echo-rest

A simple REST service, written in Go.  It uses the
[Echo web framework](https://echo.labstack.com/) and
[the pgx driver](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) to access a
[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
I use this service to provided data to my personal intranet, so it may not be
of use to anyone else, except as a starting point.
